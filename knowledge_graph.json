Down the Rabbit-Hole\n\n\nAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\nbank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into\nthe book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\nconversations in it, \u201cand what is the use of a book,\u201d thought Alice\n\u201cwithout pictures or conversations?\u201d\n\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\nhot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\nmaking a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\npicking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\nclose by her. There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it\nso _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \u201cOh\ndear! Oh dear! I shall be late!\u201d (when she thought it over afterwards,\nit occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\ntime it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\nwatch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\non, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\nhad never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\nwatch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\nlarge rabbit-hole under the hedge. In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\nin the world she was to get out again. The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\ndeep well. Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\nplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\nwas going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out\nwhat she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\nlooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\ncupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\nhung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\npassed; it was labelled \u201cORANGE MARMALADE\u201d, but to her great\ndisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\nof killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\ncupboards as she fell past it. \u201cWell!\u201d thought Alice to herself, \u201cafter such a fall as this, I shall\nthink nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they\u2019ll all think me\nat home! Why, I wouldn\u2019t say anything about it, even if I fell off the\ntop of the house!\u201d (Which was very likely true.) Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? \u201cI wonder how\nmany miles I\u2019ve fallen by this time?\u201d she said aloud. \u201cI must be\ngetting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would\nbe four thousand miles down, I think\u2014\u201d (for, you see, Alice had learnt\nseveral things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\nthough this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\nknowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\npractice to say it over) \u201c\u2014yes, that\u2019s about the right distance\u2014but\nthen I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I\u2019ve got to?\u201d (Alice had no\nidea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice\ngrand words to say.) Presently she began again. \u201cI wonder if I shall fall right _through_\nthe earth! How funny it\u2019ll seem to come out among the people that walk\nwith their heads downward!",

Please, Ma\u2019am, is this New Zealand or Australia?\u201d\n(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke\u2014fancy _curtseying_ as you\u2019re\nfalling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) \u201cAnd what\nan ignorant little girl she\u2019ll think me for asking! No, it\u2019ll never do\nto ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.\u201d\n\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\ntalking again. \u201cDinah\u2019ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!\u201d\n(Dinah was the cat.) \u201cI hope they\u2019ll remember her saucer of milk at\ntea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are\nno mice in the air, I\u2019m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that\u2019s\nvery like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?\u201d And here\nAlice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\ndreamy sort of way, \u201cDo cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?\u201d and\nsometimes, \u201cDo bats eat cats?\u201d for, you see, as she couldn\u2019t answer\neither question, it didn\u2019t much matter which way she put it. She felt\nthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\nwalking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\n\u201cNow, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\u201d when suddenly,\nthump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\nthe fall was over. Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\nshe looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another\nlong passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down\nit. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,\nand was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, \u201cOh my ears\nand whiskers, how late it\u2019s getting!\u201d She was close behind it when she\nturned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\nfrom the roof. There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\nAlice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\ndoor, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\nget out again. Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\nglass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice\u2019s\nfirst thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\nbut, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\nbut at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\ntime round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\nbehind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\nlittle golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted! Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\nmuch larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the\npassage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get\nout of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright\nflowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head\nthrough the doorway; \u201cand even if my head would go through,\u201d thought\npoor Alice, \u201cit would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,\nhow I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only\nknew how to begin.\u201d For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had\nhappened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things\nindeed were really impossible. There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\nback to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\nany rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\ntime she found a little bottle on it, (\u201cwhich certainly was not here\nbefore,\u201d said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\nlabel, with the words \u201cDRINK ME,\u201d beautifully printed on it in large\nletters. It was all very well to say \u201cDrink me,\u201d but the wise little Alice was\nnot going to do _that_ in a hurry. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll look first,\u201d she said,\n\u201cand see whether it\u2019s marked \u2018_poison_\u2019 or not\u201d; for she had read\nseveral nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and\neaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they\n_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:\nsuch as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;\nand that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually\nbleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a\nbottle marked \u201cpoison,\u201d it is almost certain to disagree with you,\nsooner or later. However, this bottle was _not_ marked \u201cpoison,\u201d so Alice ventured to\ntaste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed\nflavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and\nhot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.",

First, however, she\nwaited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:\nshe felt a little nervous about this; \u201cfor it might end, you know,\u201d\nsaid Alice to herself, \u201cin my going out altogether, like a candle. I\nwonder what I should be like then?\u201d And she tried to fancy what the\nflame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could\nnot remember ever having seen such a thing. After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\ninto the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the\ndoor, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\nwent back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\nit: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her\nbest to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\nand when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\nsat down and cried. \u201cCome, there\u2019s no use in crying like that!\u201d said Alice to herself,\nrather sharply; \u201cI advise you to leave off this minute!\u201d She generally\ngave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),\nand sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into\nher eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having\ncheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,\nfor this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. \u201cBut it\u2019s no use now,\u201d thought poor Alice, \u201cto pretend to be two\npeople! Why, there\u2019s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable\nperson!\u201d\n\nSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:\nshe opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words\n\u201cEAT ME\u201d were beautifully marked in currants. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll eat it,\u201d said\nAlice, \u201cand if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it\nmakes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I\u2019ll\nget into the garden, and I don\u2019t care which happens!\u201d\n\nShe ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, \u201cWhich way? Which\nway?\u201d, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\ngrowing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\nsize: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice\nhad got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way\nthings to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go\non in the common way. So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake. *      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. The Pool of Tears\n\n\n\u201cCuriouser and curiouser!\u201d cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that\nfor the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); \u201cnow I\u2019m\nopening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!\u201d\n(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of\nsight, they were getting so far off). \u201cOh, my poor little feet, I\nwonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I\u2019m\nsure _I_ shan\u2019t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble\nmyself about you: you must manage the best way you can;\u2014but I must be\nkind to them,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cor perhaps they won\u2019t walk the way I\nwant to go! Let me see: I\u2019ll give them a new pair of boots every\nChristmas.\u201d\n\nAnd she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. \u201cThey must\ngo by the carrier,\u201d she thought; \u201cand how funny it\u2019ll seem, sending\npresents to one\u2019s own feet! And how odd the directions will look! _Alice\u2019s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with\n     Alice\u2019s love_). Oh dear, what nonsense I\u2019m talking!\u201d\n\nJust then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was\nnow more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden\nkey and hurried off to the garden door. Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to\nlook through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more\nhopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again. \u201cYou ought to be ashamed of yourself,\u201d said Alice, \u201ca great girl like\nyou,\u201d (she might well say this), \u201cto go on crying in this way! Stop\nthis moment, I tell you!\u201d But she went on all the same, shedding\ngallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about\nfour inches deep and reaching half down the hall. After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and\nshe hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.",

      "text": "It was the White\nRabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves\nin one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a\ngreat hurry, muttering to himself as he came, \u201cOh! the Duchess, the\nDuchess! Oh! won\u2019t she be savage if I\u2019ve kept her waiting!\u201d Alice felt\nso desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the\nRabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, \u201cIf you please,\nsir\u2014\u201d The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and\nthe fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go. Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she\nkept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: \u201cDear, dear! How\nqueer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I\u2019ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the\nsame when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling\na little different. But if I\u2019m not the same, the next question is, Who\nin the world am I? Ah, _that\u2019s_ the great puzzle!\u201d And she began\nthinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as\nherself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not Ada,\u201d she said, \u201cfor her hair goes in such long\nringlets, and mine doesn\u2019t go in ringlets at all; and I\u2019m sure I can\u2019t\nbe Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a\nvery little! Besides, _she\u2019s_ she, and _I\u2019m_ I, and\u2014oh dear, how\npuzzling it all is! I\u2019ll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,\nand four times seven is\u2014oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that\nrate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn\u2019t signify: let\u2019s try\nGeography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of\nRome, and Rome\u2014no, _that\u2019s_ all wrong, I\u2019m certain! I must have been\nchanged for Mabel! I\u2019ll try and say \u2018_How doth the little_\u2014\u2019\u201d and she\ncrossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began\nto repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words\ndid not come the same as they used to do:\u2014\n\n\u201cHow doth the little crocodile\n    Improve his shining tail,\nAnd pour the waters of the Nile\n    On every golden scale! \u201cHow cheerfully he seems to grin,\n    How neatly spread his claws,\nAnd welcome little fishes in\n    With gently smiling jaws!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure those are not the right words,\u201d said poor Alice, and her eyes\nfilled with tears again as she went on, \u201cI must be Mabel after all, and\nI shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to\nno toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I\u2019ve\nmade up my mind about it; if I\u2019m Mabel, I\u2019ll stay down here! It\u2019ll be\nno use their putting their heads down and saying \u2018Come up again, dear!\u2019\nI shall only look up and say \u2018Who am I then? Tell me that first, and\nthen, if I like being that person, I\u2019ll come up: if not, I\u2019ll stay down\nhere till I\u2019m somebody else\u2019\u2014but, oh dear!\u201d cried Alice, with a sudden\nburst of tears, \u201cI do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so\n_very_ tired of being all alone here!\u201d\n\nAs she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see\nthat she had put on one of the Rabbit\u2019s little white kid gloves while\nshe was talking. \u201cHow _can_ I have done that?\u201d she thought. \u201cI must be\ngrowing small again.\u201d She got up and went to the table to measure\nherself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was\nnow about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon\nfound out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she\ndropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether. \u201cThat _was_ a narrow escape!\u201d said Alice, a good deal frightened at the\nsudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; \u201cand\nnow for the garden!\u201d and she ran with all speed back to the little\ndoor: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden\nkey was lying on the glass table as before, \u201cand things are worse than\never,\u201d thought the poor child, \u201cfor I never was so small as this\nbefore, never! And I declare it\u2019s too bad, that it is!\u201d\n\nAs she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,\nsplash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that\nshe had somehow fallen into the sea, \u201cand in that case I can go back by\nrailway,\u201d she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in\nher life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\nto on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\nsea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\nof lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she\nsoon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when\nshe was nine feet high. \u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t cried so much!\u201d said Alice, as she swam about, trying\nto find her way out. \u201cI shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by\nbeing drowned in my own tears!",

However, everything is queer to-day.\u201d\n\nJust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\noff, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\nit must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\nshe was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\nslipped in like herself. \u201cWould it be of any use, now,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cto speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\nlikely it can talk: at any rate, there\u2019s no harm in trying.\u201d So she\nbegan: \u201cO Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired\nof swimming about here, O Mouse!\u201d (Alice thought this must be the right\nway of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\nshe remembered having seen in her brother\u2019s Latin Grammar, \u201cA mouse\u2014of\na mouse\u2014to a mouse\u2014a mouse\u2014O mouse!\u201d) The Mouse looked at her rather\ninquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\nbut it said nothing. \u201cPerhaps it doesn\u2019t understand English,\u201d thought Alice; \u201cI daresay it\u2019s\na French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.\u201d (For, with all\nher knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\nanything had happened.) So she began again: \u201cO\u00f9 est ma chatte?\u201d which\nwas the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a\nsudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with\nfright. \u201cOh, I beg your pardon!\u201d cried Alice hastily, afraid that she\nhad hurt the poor animal\u2019s feelings. \u201cI quite forgot you didn\u2019t like\ncats.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot like cats!\u201d cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. \u201cWould\n_you_ like cats if you were me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, perhaps not,\u201d said Alice in a soothing tone: \u201cdon\u2019t be angry\nabout it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you\u2019d\ntake a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear\nquiet thing,\u201d Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about\nin the pool, \u201cand she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her\npaws and washing her face\u2014and she is such a nice soft thing to\nnurse\u2014and she\u2019s such a capital one for catching mice\u2014oh, I beg your\npardon!\u201d cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all\nover, and she felt certain it must be really offended. \u201cWe won\u2019t talk\nabout her any more if you\u2019d rather not.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe indeed!\u201d cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his\ntail. \u201cAs if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always\n_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don\u2019t let me hear the name\nagain!\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t indeed!\u201d said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\nconversation. \u201cAre you\u2014are you fond\u2014of\u2014of dogs?\u201d The Mouse did not\nanswer, so Alice went on eagerly: \u201cThere is such a nice little dog near\nour house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you\nknow, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it\u2019ll fetch things when\nyou throw them, and it\u2019ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts\nof things\u2014I can\u2019t remember half of them\u2014and it belongs to a farmer, you\nknow, and he says it\u2019s so useful, it\u2019s worth a hundred pounds! He says\nit kills all the rats and\u2014oh dear!\u201d cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve offended it again!\u201d For the Mouse was swimming away\nfrom her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the\npool as it went. So she called softly after it, \u201cMouse dear! Do come back again, and we\nwon\u2019t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don\u2019t like them!\u201d When the\nMouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face\nwas quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low\ntrembling voice, \u201cLet us get to the shore, and then I\u2019ll tell you my\nhistory, and you\u2019ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\u201d\n\nIt was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\nbirds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a\nDodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice\nled the way, and the whole party swam to the shore. CHAPTER III. A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale\n\n\nThey were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank\u2014the\nbirds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close\nto them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable. The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a\nconsultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite\nnatural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if\nshe had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument\nwith the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, \u201cI am\nolder than you, and must know better;\u201d and this Alice would not allow\nwithout knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to\ntell its age, there was no more to be said. At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,\ncalled out, \u201cSit down, all of you, and listen to me!",

This\nis the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! \u2018William\nthe Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted\nto by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much\naccustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of\nMercia and Northumbria\u2014\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cUgh!\u201d said the Lory, with a shiver. \u201cI beg your pardon!\u201d said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: \u201cDid\nyou speak?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot I!\u201d said the Lory hastily. \u201cI thought you did,\u201d said the Mouse. \u201c\u2014I proceed. \u2018Edwin and Morcar,\nthe earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even\nStigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable\u2014\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cFound _what_?\u201d said the Duck. \u201cFound _it_,\u201d the Mouse replied rather crossly: \u201cof course you know\nwhat \u2018it\u2019 means.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what \u2018it\u2019 means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,\u201d said the\nDuck: \u201cit\u2019s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the\narchbishop find?\u201d\n\nThe Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, \u201c\u2018\u2014found\nit advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him\nthe crown. William\u2019s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence\nof his Normans\u2014\u2019 How are you getting on now, my dear?\u201d it continued,\nturning to Alice as it spoke. \u201cAs wet as ever,\u201d said Alice in a melancholy tone: \u201cit doesn\u2019t seem to\ndry me at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, \u201cI move\nthat the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic\nremedies\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeak English!\u201d said the Eaglet. \u201cI don\u2019t know the meaning of half\nthose long words, and, what\u2019s more, I don\u2019t believe you do either!\u201d And\nthe Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds\ntittered audibly. \u201cWhat I was going to say,\u201d said the Dodo in an offended tone, \u201cwas,\nthat the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat _is_ a Caucus-race?\u201d said Alice; not that she wanted much to\nknow, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to\nspeak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything. \u201cWhy,\u201d said the Dodo, \u201cthe best way to explain it is to do it.\u201d (And,\nas you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will\ntell you how the Dodo managed it.) First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (\u201cthe exact\nshape doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d it said,) and then all the party were placed\nalong the course, here and there. There was no \u201cOne, two, three, and\naway,\u201d but they began running when they liked, and left off when they\nliked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,\nwhen they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry\nagain, the Dodo suddenly called out \u201cThe race is over!\u201d and they all\ncrowded round it, panting, and asking, \u201cBut who has won?\u201d\n\nThis question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of\nthought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its\nforehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the\npictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo\nsaid, \u201c_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut who is to give the prizes?\u201d quite a chorus of voices asked. \u201cWhy, _she_, of course,\u201d said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one\nfinger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a\nconfused way, \u201cPrizes! Prizes!\u201d\n\nAlice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her\npocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had\nnot got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly\none a-piece, all round. \u201cBut she must have a prize herself, you know,\u201d said the Mouse. \u201cOf course,\u201d the Dodo replied very gravely. \u201cWhat else have you got in\nyour pocket?\u201d he went on, turning to Alice. \u201cOnly a thimble,\u201d said Alice sadly. \u201cHand it over here,\u201d said the Dodo. Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly\npresented the thimble, saying \u201cWe beg your acceptance of this elegant\nthimble;\u201d and, when it had finished this short speech, they all\ncheered. Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave\nthat she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything\nto say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as\nshe could. The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and\nconfusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste\ntheirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and\nbegged the Mouse to tell them something more.",

Let this be a lesson to you never to lose\n_your_ temper!\u201d \u201cHold your tongue, Ma!\u201d said the young Crab, a little\nsnappishly. \u201cYou\u2019re enough to try the patience of an oyster!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!\u201d said Alice aloud,\naddressing nobody in particular. \u201cShe\u2019d soon fetch it back!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?\u201d said the\nLory. Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:\n\u201cDinah\u2019s our cat. And she\u2019s such a capital one for catching mice you\ncan\u2019t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,\nshe\u2019ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!\u201d\n\nThis speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the\nbirds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very\ncarefully, remarking, \u201cI really must be getting home; the night-air\ndoesn\u2019t suit my throat!\u201d and a Canary called out in a trembling voice\nto its children, \u201cCome away, my dears! It\u2019s high time you were all in\nbed!\u201d On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left\nalone. \u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t mentioned Dinah!\u201d she said to herself in a melancholy\ntone. \u201cNobody seems to like her, down here, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s the best\ncat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you\nany more!\u201d And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very\nlonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a\nlittle pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up\neagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was\ncoming back to finish his story. CHAPTER IV. The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill\n\n\nIt was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking\nanxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard\nit muttering to itself \u201cThe Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh\nmy fur and whiskers! She\u2019ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are\nferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?\u201d Alice guessed in a\nmoment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid\ngloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but\nthey were nowhere to be seen\u2014everything seemed to have changed since\nher swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the\nlittle door, had vanished completely. Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and\ncalled out to her in an angry tone, \u201cWhy, Mary Ann, what _are_ you\ndoing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and\na fan! Quick, now!\u201d And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off\nat once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the\nmistake it had made. \u201cHe took me for his housemaid,\u201d she said to herself as she ran. \u201cHow\nsurprised he\u2019ll be when he finds out who I am! But I\u2019d better take him\nhis fan and gloves\u2014that is, if I can find them.\u201d As she said this, she\ncame upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass\nplate with the name \u201cW. RABBIT,\u201d engraved upon it.",

      "text": "She went in without\nknocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the\nreal Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the\nfan and gloves. \u201cHow queer it seems,\u201d Alice said to herself, \u201cto be going messages for\na rabbit! I suppose Dinah\u2019ll be sending me on messages next!\u201d And she\nbegan fancying the sort of thing that would happen: \u201c\u2018Miss Alice! Come\nhere directly, and get ready for your walk!\u2019 \u2018Coming in a minute,\nnurse! But I\u2019ve got to see that the mouse doesn\u2019t get out.\u2019 Only I\ndon\u2019t think,\u201d Alice went on, \u201cthat they\u2019d let Dinah stop in the house\nif it began ordering people about like that!\u201d\n\nBy this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table\nin the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three\npairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the\ngloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a\nlittle bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label\nthis time with the words \u201cDRINK ME,\u201d but nevertheless she uncorked it\nand put it to her lips. \u201cI know _something_ interesting is sure to\nhappen,\u201d she said to herself, \u201cwhenever I eat or drink anything; so\nI\u2019ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it\u2019ll make me grow large\nagain, for really I\u2019m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\u201d\n\nIt did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\ndrunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\nand had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put\ndown the bottle, saying to herself \u201cThat\u2019s quite enough\u2014I hope I shan\u2019t\ngrow any more\u2014As it is, I can\u2019t get out at the door\u2014I do wish I hadn\u2019t\ndrunk quite so much!\u201d\n\nAlas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,\nand very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there\nwas not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with\none elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out\nof the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself \u201cNow I\ncan do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?\u201d\n\nLuckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,\nand she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there\nseemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\nagain, no wonder she felt unhappy. \u201cIt was much pleasanter at home,\u201d thought poor Alice, \u201cwhen one wasn\u2019t\nalways growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\nrabbits. I almost wish I hadn\u2019t gone down that rabbit-hole\u2014and yet\u2014and\nyet\u2014it\u2019s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what\n_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied\nthat kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of\none! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And\nwhen I grow up, I\u2019ll write one\u2014but I\u2019m grown up now,\u201d she added in a\nsorrowful tone; \u201cat least there\u2019s no room to grow up any more _here_.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut then,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cshall I _never_ get any older than I am\nnow? That\u2019ll be a comfort, one way\u2014never to be an old woman\u2014but\nthen\u2014always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn\u2019t like _that!_\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you foolish Alice!\u201d she answered herself. \u201cHow can you learn\nlessons in here? Why, there\u2019s hardly room for _you_, and no room at all\nfor any lesson-books!\u201d\n\nAnd so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and\nmaking quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes\nshe heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen. \u201cMary Ann! Mary Ann!\u201d said the voice. \u201cFetch me my gloves this moment!\u201d\nThen came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was\nthe Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the\nhouse, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as\nlarge as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it. Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as\nthe door opened inwards, and Alice\u2019s elbow was pressed hard against it,\nthat attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself \u201cThen I\u2019ll\ngo round and get in at the window.\u201d\n\n\u201c_That_ you won\u2019t!\u201d thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied\nshe heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\nhand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,\nbut she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\nfrom which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\ncucumber-frame, or something of the sort. Next came an angry voice\u2014the Rabbit\u2019s\u2014\u201cPat! Pat! Where are you?\u201d And\nthen a voice she had never heard before, \u201cSure then I\u2019m here! Digging\nfor apples, yer honour!\u201d\n\n\u201cDigging for apples, indeed!\u201d said the Rabbit angrily. \u201cHere! Come and\nhelp me out of _this!_\u201d (Sounds of more broken glass.)",

Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole\nwindow!\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, it does, yer honour: but it\u2019s an arm for all that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!\u201d\n\nThere was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers\nnow and then; such as, \u201cSure, I don\u2019t like it, yer honour, at all, at\nall!\u201d \u201cDo as I tell you, you coward!\u201d and at last she spread out her\nhand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were\n_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. \u201cWhat a number\nof cucumber-frames there must be!\u201d thought Alice. \u201cI wonder what\nthey\u2019ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they\n_could!_ I\u2019m sure _I_ don\u2019t want to stay in here any longer!\u201d\n\nShe waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a\nrumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all\ntalking together: she made out the words: \u201cWhere\u2019s the other\nladder?\u2014Why, I hadn\u2019t to bring but one; Bill\u2019s got the other\u2014Bill! fetch it here, lad!\u2014Here, put \u2019em up at this corner\u2014No, tie \u2019em\ntogether first\u2014they don\u2019t reach half high enough yet\u2014Oh! they\u2019ll do\nwell enough; don\u2019t be particular\u2014Here, Bill! catch hold of this\nrope\u2014Will the roof bear?\u2014Mind that loose slate\u2014Oh, it\u2019s coming down! Heads below!\u201d (a loud crash)\u2014\u201cNow, who did that?\u2014It was Bill, I\nfancy\u2014Who\u2019s to go down the chimney?\u2014Nay, _I_ shan\u2019t! _You_ do\nit!\u2014_That_ I won\u2019t, then!\u2014Bill\u2019s to go down\u2014Here, Bill! the master says\nyou\u2019re to go down the chimney!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! So Bill\u2019s got to come down the chimney, has he?\u201d said Alice to\nherself. \u201cShy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn\u2019t be in\nBill\u2019s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but\nI _think_ I can kick a little!\u201d\n\nShe drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till\nshe heard a little animal (she couldn\u2019t guess of what sort it was)\nscratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,\nsaying to herself \u201cThis is Bill,\u201d she gave one sharp kick, and waited\nto see what would happen next. The first thing she heard was a general chorus of \u201cThere goes Bill!\u201d\nthen the Rabbit\u2019s voice along\u2014\u201cCatch him, you by the hedge!\u201d then\nsilence, and then another confusion of voices\u2014\u201cHold up his head\u2014Brandy\nnow\u2014Don\u2019t choke him\u2014How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell\nus all about it!\u201d\n\nLast came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (\u201cThat\u2019s Bill,\u201d thought\nAlice,) \u201cWell, I hardly know\u2014No more, thank ye; I\u2019m better now\u2014but I\u2019m\na deal too flustered to tell you\u2014all I know is, something comes at me\nlike a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you did, old fellow!\u201d said the others. \u201cWe must burn the house down!\u201d said the Rabbit\u2019s voice; and Alice\ncalled out as loud as she could, \u201cIf you do, I\u2019ll set Dinah at you!\u201d\n\nThere was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, \u201cI\nwonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, they\u2019d take the\nroof off.\u201d After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\nAlice heard the Rabbit say, \u201cA barrowful will do, to begin with.\u201d\n\n\u201cA barrowful of _what?_\u201d thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,\nfor the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\nwindow, and some of them hit her in the face. \u201cI\u2019ll put a stop to\nthis,\u201d she said to herself, and shouted out, \u201cYou\u2019d better not do that\nagain!\u201d which produced another dead silence. Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\nlittle cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\nhead. \u201cIf I eat one of these cakes,\u201d she thought, \u201cit\u2019s sure to make\n_some_ change in my size; and as it can\u2019t possibly make me larger, it\nmust make me smaller, I suppose.\u201d\n\nSo she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\nbegan shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get\nthrough the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of\nlittle animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,\nwas in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\nsomething out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\nappeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\nsafe in a thick wood. \u201cThe first thing I\u2019ve got to do,\u201d said Alice to herself, as she\nwandered about in the wood, \u201cis to grow to my right size again; and the\nsecond thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that\nwill be the best plan.\u201d\n\nIt sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\narranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\nhow to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among\nthe trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\ngreat hurry.",

      "text": "An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\nfeebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. \u201cPoor little\nthing!\u201d said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to\nit; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it\nmight be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in\nspite of all her coaxing. Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\nheld it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\nall its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\nand made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\nto keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\nother side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\nover heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was\nvery like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\nmoment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\nthe puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\nlittle way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\nall the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\nits tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut. This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\nset off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,\nand till the puppy\u2019s bark sounded quite faint in the distance. \u201cAnd yet what a dear little puppy it was!\u201d said Alice, as she leant\nagainst a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\nleaves: \u201cI should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if\u2014if I\u2019d\nonly been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I\u2019d nearly forgotten that\nI\u2019ve got to grow up again! Let me see\u2014how _is_ it to be managed? I\nsuppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great\nquestion is, what?\u201d\n\nThe great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at\nthe flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\nlooked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as\nherself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and\nbehind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what\nwas on the top of it. She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\nmushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue\ncaterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly\nsmoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of\nanything else. CHAPTER V.\nAdvice from a Caterpillar\n\n\nThe Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in\nsilence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and\naddressed her in a languid, sleepy voice. \u201cWho are _you?_\u201d said the Caterpillar. This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,\nrather shyly, \u201cI\u2014I hardly know, sir, just at present\u2014at least I know\nwho I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been\nchanged several times since then.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d said the Caterpillar sternly. \u201cExplain\nyourself!\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t explain _myself_, I\u2019m afraid, sir,\u201d said Alice, \u201cbecause I\u2019m\nnot myself, you see.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see,\u201d said the Caterpillar. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t put it more clearly,\u201d Alice replied very politely,\n\u201cfor I can\u2019t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many\ndifferent sizes in a day is very confusing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d said the Caterpillar. \u201cWell, perhaps you haven\u2019t found it so yet,\u201d said Alice; \u201cbut when you\nhave to turn into a chrysalis\u2014you will some day, you know\u2014and then\nafter that into a butterfly, I should think you\u2019ll feel it a little\nqueer, won\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a bit,\u201d said the Caterpillar. \u201cWell, perhaps your feelings may be different,\u201d said Alice; \u201call I know\nis, it would feel very queer to _me_.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou!\u201d said the Caterpillar contemptuously. \u201cWho are _you?_\u201d\n\nWhich brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar\u2019s making such _very_\nshort remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, \u201cI\nthink, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d said the Caterpillar. Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any\ngood reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant\nstate of mind, she turned away. \u201cCome back!\u201d the Caterpillar called after her. \u201cI\u2019ve something\nimportant to say!\u201d\n\nThis sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again. \u201cKeep your temper,\u201d said the Caterpillar. \u201cIs that all?\u201d said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she\ncould. \u201cNo,\u201d said the Caterpillar. Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,\nand perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing.",

      "text": "For\nsome minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded\nits arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, \u201cSo you\nthink you\u2019re changed, do you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I am, sir,\u201d said Alice; \u201cI can\u2019t remember things as I\nused\u2014and I don\u2019t keep the same size for ten minutes together!\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t remember _what_ things?\u201d said the Caterpillar. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve tried to say \u201cHow doth the little busy bee,\u201d but it all\ncame different!\u201d Alice replied in a very melancholy voice. \u201cRepeat, \u201c_You are old, Father William_,\u2019\u201d said the Caterpillar. Alice folded her hands, and began:\u2014\n\n\u201cYou are old, Father William,\u201d the young man said,\n    \u201cAnd your hair has become very white;\nAnd yet you incessantly stand on your head\u2014\n    Do you think, at your age, it is right?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my youth,\u201d Father William replied to his son,\n    \u201cI feared it might injure the brain;\nBut, now that I\u2019m perfectly sure I have none,\n    Why, I do it again and again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are old,\u201d said the youth, \u201cas I mentioned before,\n    And have grown most uncommonly fat;\nYet you turned a back-somersault in at the door\u2014\n    Pray, what is the reason of that?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my youth,\u201d said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\n    \u201cI kept all my limbs very supple\nBy the use of this ointment\u2014one shilling the box\u2014\n    Allow me to sell you a couple?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are old,\u201d said the youth, \u201cand your jaws are too weak\n    For anything tougher than suet;\nYet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak\u2014\n    Pray, how did you manage to do it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my youth,\u201d said his father, \u201cI took to the law,\n    And argued each case with my wife;\nAnd the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\n    Has lasted the rest of my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are old,\u201d said the youth, \u201cone would hardly suppose\n    That your eye was as steady as ever;\nYet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose\u2014\n    What made you so awfully clever?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have answered three questions, and that is enough,\u201d\n    Said his father; \u201cdon\u2019t give yourself airs! Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff? Be off, or I\u2019ll kick you down stairs!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat is not said right,\u201d said the Caterpillar. \u201cNot _quite_ right, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d said Alice, timidly; \u201csome of the\nwords have got altered.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is wrong from beginning to end,\u201d said the Caterpillar decidedly,\nand there was silence for some minutes. The Caterpillar was the first to speak. \u201cWhat size do you want to be?\u201d it asked. \u201cOh, I\u2019m not particular as to size,\u201d Alice hastily replied; \u201conly one\ndoesn\u2019t like changing so often, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI _don\u2019t_ know,\u201d said the Caterpillar. Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life\nbefore, and she felt that she was losing her temper. \u201cAre you content now?\u201d said the Caterpillar. \u201cWell, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldn\u2019t\nmind,\u201d said Alice: \u201cthree inches is such a wretched height to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a very good height indeed!\u201d said the Caterpillar angrily,\nrearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high). \u201cBut I\u2019m not used to it!\u201d pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she\nthought of herself, \u201cI wish the creatures wouldn\u2019t be so easily\noffended!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it in time,\u201d said the Caterpillar; and it put the\nhookah into its mouth and began smoking again. This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a\nminute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and\nyawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the\nmushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,\n\u201cOne side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you\ngrow shorter.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_\u201d thought Alice to\nherself. \u201cOf the mushroom,\u201d said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it\naloud; and in another moment it was out of sight. Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,\ntrying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was\nperfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at\nlast she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke\noff a bit of the edge with each hand. \u201cAnd now which is which?\u201d she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\nthe right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a\nviolent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot! She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt\nthat there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she\nset to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed\nso closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her\nmouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the\nlefthand bit.",

And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can\u2019t see you?\u201d\nShe was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,\nexcept a little shaking among the distant green leaves. As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,\nshe tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that\nher neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She\nhad just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was\ngoing to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but\nthe tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp\nhiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her\nface, and was beating her violently with its wings. \u201cSerpent!\u201d screamed the Pigeon. \u201cI\u2019m _not_ a serpent!\u201d said Alice indignantly. \u201cLet me alone!\u201d\n\n\u201cSerpent, I say again!\u201d repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued\ntone, and added with a kind of sob, \u201cI\u2019ve tried every way, and nothing\nseems to suit them!\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t the least idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d said Alice. \u201cI\u2019ve tried the roots of trees, and I\u2019ve tried banks, and I\u2019ve tried\nhedges,\u201d the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; \u201cbut those\nserpents! There\u2019s no pleasing them!\u201d\n\nAlice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in\nsaying anything more till the Pigeon had finished. \u201cAs if it wasn\u2019t trouble enough hatching the eggs,\u201d said the Pigeon;\n\u201cbut I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I\nhaven\u2019t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very sorry you\u2019ve been annoyed,\u201d said Alice, who was beginning to\nsee its meaning. \u201cAnd just as I\u2019d taken the highest tree in the wood,\u201d continued the\nPigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, \u201cand just as I was thinking I\nshould be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down\nfrom the sky! Ugh, Serpent!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m _not_ a serpent, I tell you!\u201d said Alice. \u201cI\u2019m a\u2014I\u2019m a\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell! _What_ are you?\u201d said the Pigeon. \u201cI can see you\u2019re trying to\ninvent something!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m a little girl,\u201d said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered\nthe number of changes she had gone through that day. \u201cA likely story indeed!\u201d said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest\ncontempt. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never\n_one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! You\u2019re a serpent; and there\u2019s\nno use denying it. I suppose you\u2019ll be telling me next that you never\ntasted an egg!\u201d\n\n\u201cI _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,\u201d said Alice, who was a very truthful\nchild; \u201cbut little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you\nknow.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d said the Pigeon; \u201cbut if they do, why then\nthey\u2019re a kind of serpent, that\u2019s all I can say.\u201d\n\nThis was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a\nminute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, \u201cYou\u2019re\nlooking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to\nme whether you\u2019re a little girl or a serpent?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt matters a good deal to _me_,\u201d said Alice hastily; \u201cbut I\u2019m not\nlooking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn\u2019t want\n_yours_: I don\u2019t like them raw.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, be off, then!\u201d said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\ndown again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well\nas she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,\nand every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while\nshe remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,\nand she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at\nthe other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until\nshe had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height. It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it\nfelt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,\nand began talking to herself, as usual. \u201cCome, there\u2019s half my plan\ndone now! How puzzling all these changes are! I\u2019m never sure what I\u2019m\ngoing to be, from one minute to another! However, I\u2019ve got back to my\nright size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden\u2014how\n_is_ that to be done, I wonder?\u201d As she said this, she came suddenly\nupon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.",

CHAPTER VI. Pig and Pepper\n\n\nFor a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what\nto do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the\nwood\u2014(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:\notherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a\nfish)\u2014and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by\nanother footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\nfrog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled\nall over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all\nabout, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen. The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\nnearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,\nsaying, in a solemn tone, \u201cFor the Duchess. An invitation from the\nQueen to play croquet.\u201d The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn\ntone, only changing the order of the words a little, \u201cFrom the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.\u201d\n\nThen they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together. Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood\nfor fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the\nFish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the\ndoor, staring stupidly up into the sky. Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked. \u201cThere\u2019s no sort of use in knocking,\u201d said the Footman, \u201cand that for\ntwo reasons. First, because I\u2019m on the same side of the door as you\nare; secondly, because they\u2019re making such a noise inside, no one could\npossibly hear you.\u201d And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary\nnoise going on within\u2014a constant howling and sneezing, and every now\nand then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to\npieces. \u201cPlease, then,\u201d said Alice, \u201chow am I to get in?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere might be some sense in your knocking,\u201d the Footman went on\nwithout attending to her, \u201cif we had the door between us. For instance,\nif you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you\nknow.\u201d He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and\nthis Alice thought decidedly uncivil. \u201cBut perhaps he can\u2019t help it,\u201d\nshe said to herself; \u201chis eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his\nhead. But at any rate he might answer questions.\u2014How am I to get in?\u201d\nshe repeated, aloud. \u201cI shall sit here,\u201d the Footman remarked, \u201ctill tomorrow\u2014\u201d\n\nAt this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\nskimming out, straight at the Footman\u2019s head: it just grazed his nose,\nand broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him. \u201c\u2014or next day, maybe,\u201d the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly\nas if nothing had happened. \u201cHow am I to get in?\u201d asked Alice again, in a louder tone. \u201c_Are_ you to get in at all?\u201d said the Footman. \u201cThat\u2019s the first\nquestion, you know.\u201d\n\nIt was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. \u201cIt\u2019s really\ndreadful,\u201d she muttered to herself, \u201cthe way all the creatures argue. It\u2019s enough to drive one crazy!\u201d\n\nThe Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\nremark, with variations. \u201cI shall sit here,\u201d he said, \u201con and off, for\ndays and days.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what am _I_ to do?\u201d said Alice. \u201cAnything you like,\u201d said the Footman, and began whistling. \u201cOh, there\u2019s no use in talking to him,\u201d said Alice desperately: \u201che\u2019s\nperfectly idiotic!\u201d And she opened the door and went in. The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from\none end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool\nin the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire,\nstirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly too much pepper in that soup!\u201d Alice said to\nherself, as well as she could for sneezing. There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed\noccasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\nalternately without a moment\u2019s pause. The only things in the kitchen\nthat did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting\non the hearth and grinning from ear to ear. \u201cPlease would you tell me,\u201d said Alice, a little timidly, for she was\nnot quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, \u201cwhy\nyour cat grins like that?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Cheshire cat,\u201d said the Duchess, \u201cand that\u2019s why.",

While she\nwas trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the\nfire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\nthe Duchess and the baby\u2014the fire-irons came first; then followed a\nshower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of\nthem even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,\nthat it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not. \u201cOh, _please_ mind what you\u2019re doing!\u201d cried Alice, jumping up and down\nin an agony of terror. \u201cOh, there goes his _precious_ nose!\u201d as an\nunusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it\noff. \u201cIf everybody minded their own business,\u201d the Duchess said in a hoarse\ngrowl, \u201cthe world would go round a deal faster than it does.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich would _not_ be an advantage,\u201d said Alice, who felt very glad to\nget an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. \u201cJust\nthink of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the\nearth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cTalking of axes,\u201d said the Duchess, \u201cchop off her head!\u201d\n\nAlice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take\nthe hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to\nbe listening, so she went on again: \u201cTwenty-four hours, I _think_; or\nis it twelve? I\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t bother _me_,\u201d said the Duchess; \u201cI never could abide\nfigures!\u201d And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a\nsort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at\nthe end of every line:\n\n\u201cSpeak roughly to your little boy,\n    And beat him when he sneezes:\nHe only does it to annoy,\n    Because he knows it teases.\u201d\n\n\nCHORUS. (In which the cook and the baby joined):\n\n\n\u201cWow! wow! wow!\u201d\n\n\nWhile the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing\nthe baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,\nthat Alice could hardly hear the words:\u2014\n\n\u201cI speak severely to my boy,\n    I beat him when he sneezes;\nFor he can thoroughly enjoy\n    The pepper when he pleases!\u201d\n\n\nCHORUS. \u201cWow! wow! wow!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHere! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!\u201d the Duchess said to Alice,\nflinging the baby at her as she spoke. \u201cI must go and get ready to play\ncroquet with the Queen,\u201d and she hurried out of the room. The cook\nthrew a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her. Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped\nlittle creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,\n\u201cjust like a star-fish,\u201d thought Alice. The poor little thing was\nsnorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling\nitself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for\nthe first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it. As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to\ntwist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right\near and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it\nout into the open air. \u201cIf I don\u2019t take this child away with me,\u201d\nthought Alice, \u201cthey\u2019re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn\u2019t it be\nmurder to leave it behind?\u201d She said the last words out loud, and the\nlittle thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time). \u201cDon\u2019t grunt,\u201d said Alice; \u201cthat\u2019s not at all a proper way of\nexpressing yourself.\u201d\n\nThe baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face\nto see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had\na _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also\nits eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did\nnot like the look of the thing at all. \u201cBut perhaps it was only\nsobbing,\u201d she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there\nwere any tears. No, there were no tears. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to turn into a pig, my dear,\u201d\nsaid Alice, seriously, \u201cI\u2019ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind\nnow!\u201d The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible\nto say which), and they went on for some while in silence. Alice was just beginning to think to herself, \u201cNow, what am I to do\nwith this creature when I get it home?\u201d when it grunted again, so\nviolently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm.",

So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it\ntrot away quietly into the wood. \u201cIf it had grown up,\u201d she said to\nherself, \u201cit would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes\nrather a handsome pig, I think.\u201d And she began thinking over other\nchildren she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying\nto herself, \u201cif one only knew the right way to change them\u2014\u201d when she\nwas a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of\na tree a few yards off. The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she\nthought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she\nfelt that it ought to be treated with respect. \u201cCheshire Puss,\u201d she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know\nwhether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little\nwider. \u201cCome, it\u2019s pleased so far,\u201d thought Alice, and she went on. \u201cWould you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat depends a good deal on where you want to get to,\u201d said the Cat. \u201cI don\u2019t much care where\u2014\u201d said Alice. \u201cThen it doesn\u2019t matter which way you go,\u201d said the Cat. \u201c\u2014so long as I get _somewhere_,\u201d Alice added as an explanation. \u201cOh, you\u2019re sure to do that,\u201d said the Cat, \u201cif you only walk long\nenough.\u201d\n\nAlice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another\nquestion. \u201cWhat sort of people live about here?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn _that_ direction,\u201d the Cat said, waving its right paw round, \u201clives\na Hatter: and in _that_ direction,\u201d waving the other paw, \u201clives a\nMarch Hare. Visit either you like: they\u2019re both mad.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to go among mad people,\u201d Alice remarked. \u201cOh, you can\u2019t help that,\u201d said the Cat: \u201cwe\u2019re all mad here. I\u2019m mad. You\u2019re mad.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you know I\u2019m mad?\u201d said Alice. \u201cYou must be,\u201d said the Cat, \u201cor you wouldn\u2019t have come here.\u201d\n\nAlice didn\u2019t think that proved it at all; however, she went on \u201cAnd how\ndo you know that you\u2019re mad?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo begin with,\u201d said the Cat, \u201ca dog\u2019s not mad. You grant that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose so,\u201d said Alice. \u201cWell, then,\u201d the Cat went on, \u201cyou see, a dog growls when it\u2019s angry,\nand wags its tail when it\u2019s pleased. Now _I_ growl when I\u2019m pleased,\nand wag my tail when I\u2019m angry. Therefore I\u2019m mad.\u201d\n\n\u201c_I_ call it purring, not growling,\u201d said Alice. \u201cCall it what you like,\u201d said the Cat. \u201cDo you play croquet with the\nQueen to-day?\u201d\n\n\u201cI should like it very much,\u201d said Alice, \u201cbut I haven\u2019t been invited\nyet.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see me there,\u201d said the Cat, and vanished. Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer\nthings happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,\nit suddenly appeared again. \u201cBy-the-bye, what became of the baby?\u201d said the Cat. \u201cI\u2019d nearly\nforgotten to ask.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt turned into a pig,\u201d Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back\nin a natural way. \u201cI thought it would,\u201d said the Cat, and vanished again. Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not\nappear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in\nwhich the March Hare was said to live. \u201cI\u2019ve seen hatters before,\u201d she\nsaid to herself; \u201cthe March Hare will be much the most interesting, and\nperhaps as this is May it won\u2019t be raving mad\u2014at least not so mad as it\nwas in March.\u201d As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat\nagain, sitting on a branch of a tree. \u201cDid you say pig, or fig?\u201d said the Cat. \u201cI said pig,\u201d replied Alice; \u201cand I wish you wouldn\u2019t keep appearing\nand vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,\nbeginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which\nremained some time after the rest of it had gone. \u201cWell! I\u2019ve often seen a cat without a grin,\u201d thought Alice; \u201cbut a\ngrin without a cat! It\u2019s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!\u201d\n\nShe had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of\nthe March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the\nchimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It\nwas so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had\nnibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself\nto about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather\ntimidly, saying to herself \u201cSuppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I\u2019d gone to see the Hatter instead!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party\n\n\nThere was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the\nMarch Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting\nbetween them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a\ncushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head.",

No room!\u201d they cried out when they saw\nAlice coming. \u201cThere\u2019s _plenty_ of room!\u201d said Alice indignantly, and\nshe sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table. \u201cHave some wine,\u201d the March Hare said in an encouraging tone. Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. \u201cI don\u2019t see any wine,\u201d she remarked. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any,\u201d said the March Hare. \u201cThen it wasn\u2019t very civil of you to offer it,\u201d said Alice angrily. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,\u201d said\nthe March Hare. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was _your_ table,\u201d said Alice; \u201cit\u2019s laid for a great\nmany more than three.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour hair wants cutting,\u201d said the Hatter. He had been looking at\nAlice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first\nspeech. \u201cYou should learn not to make personal remarks,\u201d Alice said with some\nseverity; \u201cit\u2019s very rude.\u201d\n\nThe Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_\nwas, \u201cWhy is a raven like a writing-desk?\u201d\n\n\u201cCome, we shall have some fun now!\u201d thought Alice. \u201cI\u2019m glad they\u2019ve\nbegun asking riddles.\u2014I believe I can guess that,\u201d she added aloud. \u201cDo you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?\u201d said\nthe March Hare. \u201cExactly so,\u201d said Alice. \u201cThen you should say what you mean,\u201d the March Hare went on. \u201cI do,\u201d Alice hastily replied; \u201cat least\u2014at least I mean what I\nsay\u2014that\u2019s the same thing, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot the same thing a bit!\u201d said the Hatter. \u201cYou might just as well\nsay that \u2018I see what I eat\u2019 is the same thing as \u2018I eat what I see\u2019!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou might just as well say,\u201d added the March Hare, \u201cthat \u2018I like what\nI get\u2019 is the same thing as \u2018I get what I like\u2019!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou might just as well say,\u201d added the Dormouse, who seemed to be\ntalking in his sleep, \u201cthat \u2018I breathe when I sleep\u2019 is the same thing\nas \u2018I sleep when I breathe\u2019!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt _is_ the same thing with you,\u201d said the Hatter, and here the\nconversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while\nAlice thought over all she could remember about ravens and\nwriting-desks, which wasn\u2019t much. The Hatter was the first to break the silence. \u201cWhat day of the month\nis it?\u201d he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his\npocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,\nand holding it to his ear. Alice considered a little, and then said \u201cThe fourth.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo days wrong!\u201d sighed the Hatter. \u201cI told you butter wouldn\u2019t suit\nthe works!\u201d he added looking angrily at the March Hare. \u201cIt was the _best_ butter,\u201d the March Hare meekly replied. \u201cYes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,\u201d the Hatter grumbled:\n\u201cyou shouldn\u2019t have put it in with the bread-knife.\u201d\n\nThe March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped\nit into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of\nnothing better to say than his first remark, \u201cIt was the _best_ butter,\nyou know.\u201d\n\nAlice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. \u201cWhat a\nfunny watch!\u201d she remarked. \u201cIt tells the day of the month, and doesn\u2019t\ntell what o\u2019clock it is!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy should it?\u201d muttered the Hatter. \u201cDoes _your_ watch tell you what\nyear it is?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Alice replied very readily: \u201cbut that\u2019s because it\nstays the same year for such a long time together.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich is just the case with _mine_,\u201d said the Hatter. Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter\u2019s remark seemed to have no\nsort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. \u201cI don\u2019t quite\nunderstand you,\u201d she said, as politely as she could. \u201cThe Dormouse is asleep again,\u201d said the Hatter, and he poured a little\nhot tea upon its nose. The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its\neyes, \u201cOf course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you guessed the riddle yet?\u201d the Hatter said, turning to Alice\nagain. \u201cNo, I give it up,\u201d Alice replied: \u201cwhat\u2019s the answer?\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t the slightest idea,\u201d said the Hatter. \u201cNor I,\u201d said the March Hare. Alice sighed wearily. \u201cI think you might do something better with the\ntime,\u201d she said, \u201cthan waste it in asking riddles that have no\nanswers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you knew Time as well as I do,\u201d said the Hatter, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t talk\nabout wasting _it_. It\u2019s _him_.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d said Alice. \u201cOf course you don\u2019t!\u201d the Hatter said, tossing his head\ncontemptuously. \u201cI dare say you never even spoke to Time!\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps not,\u201d Alice cautiously replied: \u201cbut I know I have to beat\ntime when I learn music.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh! that accounts for it,\u201d said the Hatter. \u201cHe won\u2019t stand beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he\u2019d do almost anything\nyou liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o\u2019clock in\nthe morning, just time to begin lessons: you\u2019d only have to whisper a\nhint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling!",

The Hatter shook his head mournfully. \u201cNot I!\u201d he replied. \u201cWe\nquarrelled last March\u2014just before _he_ went mad, you know\u2014\u201d (pointing\nwith his tea spoon at the March Hare,) \u201c\u2014it was at the great concert\ngiven by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\n\n\u2018Twinkle, twinkle, little bat! How I wonder what you\u2019re at!\u2019\n\n\nYou know the song, perhaps?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard something like it,\u201d said Alice. \u201cIt goes on, you know,\u201d the Hatter continued, \u201cin this way:\u2014\n\n\u2018Up above the world you fly,\nLike a tea-tray in the sky. Twinkle, twinkle\u2014\u2019\u201d\n\n\nHere the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep\n\u201c_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_\u2014\u201d and went on so long that they\nhad to pinch it to make it stop. \u201cWell, I\u2019d hardly finished the first verse,\u201d said the Hatter, \u201cwhen the\nQueen jumped up and bawled out, \u2018He\u2019s murdering the time! Off with his\nhead!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cHow dreadfully savage!\u201d exclaimed Alice. \u201cAnd ever since that,\u201d the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, \u201che won\u2019t\ndo a thing I ask! It\u2019s always six o\u2019clock now.\u201d\n\nA bright idea came into Alice\u2019s head. \u201cIs that the reason so many\ntea-things are put out here?\u201d she asked. \u201cYes, that\u2019s it,\u201d said the Hatter with a sigh: \u201cit\u2019s always tea-time,\nand we\u2019ve no time to wash the things between whiles.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you keep moving round, I suppose?\u201d said Alice. \u201cExactly so,\u201d said the Hatter: \u201cas the things get used up.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what happens when you come to the beginning again?\u201d Alice ventured\nto ask. \u201cSuppose we change the subject,\u201d the March Hare interrupted, yawning. \u201cI\u2019m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know one,\u201d said Alice, rather alarmed at the\nproposal. \u201cThen the Dormouse shall!\u201d they both cried. \u201cWake up, Dormouse!\u201d And\nthey pinched it on both sides at once. The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. \u201cI wasn\u2019t asleep,\u201d he said in a\nhoarse, feeble voice: \u201cI heard every word you fellows were saying.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell us a story!\u201d said the March Hare. \u201cYes, please do!\u201d pleaded Alice. \u201cAnd be quick about it,\u201d added the Hatter, \u201cor you\u2019ll be asleep again\nbefore it\u2019s done.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce upon a time there were three little sisters,\u201d the Dormouse began\nin a great hurry; \u201cand their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and\nthey lived at the bottom of a well\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did they live on?\u201d said Alice, who always took a great interest\nin questions of eating and drinking. \u201cThey lived on treacle,\u201d said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or\ntwo. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t have done that, you know,\u201d Alice gently remarked;\n\u201cthey\u2019d have been ill.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo they were,\u201d said the Dormouse; \u201c_very_ ill.\u201d\n\nAlice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of\nliving would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: \u201cBut\nwhy did they live at the bottom of a well?\u201d\n\n\u201cTake some more tea,\u201d the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly. \u201cI\u2019ve had nothing yet,\u201d Alice replied in an offended tone, \u201cso I can\u2019t\ntake more.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean you can\u2019t take _less_,\u201d said the Hatter: \u201cit\u2019s very easy to\ntake _more_ than nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody asked _your_ opinion,\u201d said Alice. \u201cWho\u2019s making personal remarks now?\u201d the Hatter asked triumphantly. Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to\nsome tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and\nrepeated her question. \u201cWhy did they live at the bottom of a well?\u201d\n\nThe Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then\nsaid, \u201cIt was a treacle-well.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing!\u201d Alice was beginning very angrily, but the\nHatter and the March Hare went \u201cSh! sh!\u201d and the Dormouse sulkily\nremarked, \u201cIf you can\u2019t be civil, you\u2019d better finish the story for\nyourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, please go on!\u201d Alice said very humbly; \u201cI won\u2019t interrupt again. I\ndare say there may be _one_.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne, indeed!\u201d said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to\ngo on. \u201cAnd so these three little sisters\u2014they were learning to draw,\nyou know\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did they draw?\u201d said Alice, quite forgetting her promise. \u201cTreacle,\u201d said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time. \u201cI want a clean cup,\u201d interrupted the Hatter: \u201clet\u2019s all move one place\non.\u201d\n\nHe moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare\nmoved into the Dormouse\u2019s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the\nplace of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any\nadvantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than\nbefore, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate. Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very\ncautiously: \u201cBut I don\u2019t understand.",

Alice was silent. The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a\ndoze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a\nlittle shriek, and went on: \u201c\u2014that begins with an M, such as\nmouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness\u2014you know you say\nthings are \u201cmuch of a muchness\u201d\u2014did you ever see such a thing as a\ndrawing of a muchness?\u201d\n\n\u201cReally, now you ask me,\u201d said Alice, very much confused, \u201cI don\u2019t\nthink\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you shouldn\u2019t talk,\u201d said the Hatter. This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in\ngreat disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and\nneither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she\nlooked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:\nthe last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into\nthe teapot. \u201cAt any rate I\u2019ll never go _there_ again!\u201d said Alice as she picked her\nway through the wood. \u201cIt\u2019s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in\nall my life!\u201d\n\nJust as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door\nleading right into it. \u201cThat\u2019s very curious!\u201d she thought. \u201cBut\neverything\u2019s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.\u201d And\nin she went. Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little\nglass table. \u201cNow, I\u2019ll manage better this time,\u201d she said to herself,\nand began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that\nled into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom\n(she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot\nhigh: then she walked down the little passage: and _then_\u2014she found\nherself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds\nand the cool fountains. CHAPTER VIII. The Queen\u2019s Croquet-Ground\n\n\nA large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses\ngrowing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily\npainting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she\nwent nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard\none of them say, \u201cLook out now, Five! Don\u2019t go splashing paint over me\nlike that!\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t help it,\u201d said Five, in a sulky tone; \u201cSeven jogged my\nelbow.\u201d\n\nOn which Seven looked up and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, Five! Always lay the\nblame on others!\u201d\n\n\u201c_You\u2019d_ better not talk!\u201d said Five. \u201cI heard the Queen say only\nyesterday you deserved to be beheaded!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d said the one who had spoken first. \u201cThat\u2019s none of _your_ business, Two!\u201d said Seven. \u201cYes, it _is_ his business!\u201d said Five, \u201cand I\u2019ll tell him\u2014it was for\nbringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.\u201d\n\nSeven flung down his brush, and had just begun \u201cWell, of all the unjust\nthings\u2014\u201d when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching\nthem, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also,\nand all of them bowed low. \u201cWould you tell me,\u201d said Alice, a little timidly, \u201cwhy you are\npainting those roses?\u201d\n\nFive and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low\nvoice, \u201cWhy the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a\n_red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen\nwas to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So\nyou see, Miss, we\u2019re doing our best, afore she comes, to\u2014\u201d At this\nmoment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called\nout \u201cThe Queen! The Queen!\u201d and the three gardeners instantly threw\nthemselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,\nand Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen. First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the\nthree gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the\ncorners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with\ndiamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came\nthe royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came\njumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all\nornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,\nand among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a\nhurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went\nby without noticing her.",

Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face\nlike the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard\nof such a rule at processions; \u201cand besides, what would be the use of a\nprocession,\u201d thought she, \u201cif people had all to lie down upon their\nfaces, so that they couldn\u2019t see it?\u201d So she stood still where she was,\nand waited. When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked\nat her, and the Queen said severely \u201cWho is this?\u201d She said it to the\nKnave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply. \u201cIdiot!\u201d said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to\nAlice, she went on, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, child?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Alice, so please your Majesty,\u201d said Alice very politely;\nbut she added, to herself, \u201cWhy, they\u2019re only a pack of cards, after\nall. I needn\u2019t be afraid of them!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd who are _these?_\u201d said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners\nwho were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on\ntheir faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of\nthe pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,\nor courtiers, or three of her own children. \u201cHow should _I_ know?\u201d said Alice, surprised at her own courage. \u201cIt\u2019s\nno business of _mine_.\u201d\n\nThe Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a\nmoment like a wild beast, screamed \u201cOff with her head! Off\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNonsense!\u201d said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was\nsilent. The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said \u201cConsider, my\ndear: she is only a child!\u201d\n\nThe Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave \u201cTurn\nthem over!\u201d\n\nThe Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot. \u201cGet up!\u201d said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three\ngardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,\nthe royal children, and everybody else. \u201cLeave off that!\u201d screamed the Queen. \u201cYou make me giddy.\u201d And then,\nturning to the rose-tree, she went on, \u201cWhat _have_ you been doing\nhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cMay it please your Majesty,\u201d said Two, in a very humble tone, going\ndown on one knee as he spoke, \u201cwe were trying\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c_I_ see!\u201d said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses. \u201cOff with their heads!\u201d and the procession moved on, three of the\nsoldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran\nto Alice for protection. \u201cYou shan\u2019t be beheaded!\u201d said Alice, and she put them into a large\nflower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a\nminute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the\nothers. \u201cAre their heads off?\u201d shouted the Queen. \u201cTheir heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!\u201d the soldiers shouted\nin reply. \u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d shouted the Queen. \u201cCan you play croquet?\u201d\n\nThe soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was\nevidently meant for her. \u201cYes!\u201d shouted Alice. \u201cCome on, then!\u201d roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,\nwondering very much what would happen next. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s a very fine day!\u201d said a timid voice at her side. She was\nwalking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face. \u201cVery,\u201d said Alice: \u201c\u2014where\u2019s the Duchess?\u201d\n\n\u201cHush! Hush!\u201d said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked\nanxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon\ntiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered \u201cShe\u2019s under\nsentence of execution.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d said Alice. \u201cDid you say \u2018What a pity!\u2019?\u201d the Rabbit asked. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d said Alice: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s at all a pity. I said\n\u2018What for?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cShe boxed the Queen\u2019s ears\u2014\u201d the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little\nscream of laughter. \u201cOh, hush!\u201d the Rabbit whispered in a frightened\ntone. \u201cThe Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the\nQueen said\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGet to your places!\u201d shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and\npeople began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\nother; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\nbegan. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground\nin her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live\nhedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double\nthemselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.",

      "text": "The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:\nshe succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,\nunder her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she\nhad got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the\nhedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look\nup in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help\nbursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was\ngoing to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog\nhad unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all\nthis, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she\nwanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were\nalways getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice\nsoon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed. The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling\nall the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time\nthe Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and\nshouting \u201cOff with his head!\u201d or \u201cOff with her head!\u201d about once in a\nminute. Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any\ndispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,\n\u201cand then,\u201d thought she, \u201cwhat would become of me? They\u2019re dreadfully\nfond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there\u2019s any\none left alive!\u201d\n\nShe was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she\ncould get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious\nappearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after\nwatching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said\nto herself \u201cIt\u2019s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk\nto.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow are you getting on?\u201d said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth\nenough for it to speak with. Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s no use\nspeaking to it,\u201d she thought, \u201ctill its ears have come, or at least one\nof them.\u201d In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put\ndown her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad\nshe had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there\nwas enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared. \u201cI don\u2019t think they play at all fairly,\u201d Alice began, in rather a\ncomplaining tone, \u201cand they all quarrel so dreadfully one can\u2019t hear\noneself speak\u2014and they don\u2019t seem to have any rules in particular; at\nleast, if there are, nobody attends to them\u2014and you\u2019ve no idea how\nconfusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there\u2019s the\narch I\u2019ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\nground\u2014and I should have croqueted the Queen\u2019s hedgehog just now, only\nit ran away when it saw mine coming!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you like the Queen?\u201d said the Cat in a low voice. \u201cNot at all,\u201d said Alice: \u201cshe\u2019s so extremely\u2014\u201d Just then she noticed\nthat the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,\n\u201c\u2014likely to win, that it\u2019s hardly worth while finishing the game.\u201d\n\nThe Queen smiled and passed on. \u201cWho _are_ you talking to?\u201d said the King, going up to Alice, and\nlooking at the Cat\u2019s head with great curiosity. \u201cIt\u2019s a friend of mine\u2014a Cheshire Cat,\u201d said Alice: \u201callow me to\nintroduce it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the look of it at all,\u201d said the King: \u201chowever, it may\nkiss my hand if it likes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not,\u201d the Cat remarked. \u201cDon\u2019t be impertinent,\u201d said the King, \u201cand don\u2019t look at me like\nthat!\u201d He got behind Alice as he spoke. \u201cA cat may look at a king,\u201d said Alice. \u201cI\u2019ve read that in some book,\nbut I don\u2019t remember where.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it must be removed,\u201d said the King very decidedly, and he called\nthe Queen, who was passing at the moment, \u201cMy dear! I wish you would\nhave this cat removed!\u201d\n\nThe Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or\nsmall. \u201cOff with his head!\u201d she said, without even looking round. \u201cI\u2019ll fetch the executioner myself,\u201d said the King eagerly, and he\nhurried off. Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going\non, as she heard the Queen\u2019s voice in the distance, screaming with\npassion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\nexecuted for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look\nof things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew\nwhether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog. The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed\nto Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the\nother: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to\nthe other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a\nhelpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.",

      "text": "By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\nwas over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t\nmatter much,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cas all the arches are gone from this side\nof the ground.\u201d So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not\nescape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her\nfriend. When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite\na large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between\nthe executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,\nwhile all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable. The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle\nthe question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they\nall spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly\nwhat they said. The executioner\u2019s argument was, that you couldn\u2019t cut off a head unless\nthere was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a\nthing before, and he wasn\u2019t going to begin at _his_ time of life. The King\u2019s argument was, that anything that had a head could be\nbeheaded, and that you weren\u2019t to talk nonsense. The Queen\u2019s argument was, that if something wasn\u2019t done about it in\nless than no time she\u2019d have everybody executed, all round. (It was\nthis last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and\nanxious.) Alice could think of nothing else to say but \u201cIt belongs to the\nDuchess: you\u2019d better ask _her_ about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s in prison,\u201d the Queen said to the executioner: \u201cfetch her here.\u201d\nAnd the executioner went off like an arrow. The Cat\u2019s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the\ntime he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so\nthe King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it,\nwhile the rest of the party went back to the game. CHAPTER IX. The Mock Turtle\u2019s Story\n\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!\u201d\nsaid the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice\u2019s,\nand they walked off together. Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought\nto herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so\nsavage when they met in the kitchen. \u201cWhen _I\u2019m_ a Duchess,\u201d she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful\ntone though), \u201cI won\u2019t have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_. Soup\ndoes very well without\u2014Maybe it\u2019s always pepper that makes people\nhot-tempered,\u201d she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new\nkind of rule, \u201cand vinegar that makes them sour\u2014and camomile that makes\nthem bitter\u2014and\u2014and barley-sugar and such things that make children\nsweet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn\u2019t be\nso stingy about it, you know\u2014\u201d\n\nShe had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little\nstartled when she heard her voice close to her ear. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking\nabout something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can\u2019t\ntell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in\na bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps it hasn\u2019t one,\u201d Alice ventured to remark. \u201cTut, tut, child!\u201d said the Duchess. \u201cEverything\u2019s got a moral, if only\nyou can find it.\u201d And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice\u2019s side as\nshe spoke. Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the\nDuchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the\nright height to rest her chin upon Alice\u2019s shoulder, and it was an\nuncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she\nbore it as well as she could. \u201cThe game\u2019s going on rather better now,\u201d she said, by way of keeping up\nthe conversation a little. \u201c\u2019Tis so,\u201d said the Duchess: \u201cand the moral of that is\u2014\u2018Oh, \u2019tis love,\n\u2019tis love, that makes the world go round!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody said,\u201d Alice whispered, \u201cthat it\u2019s done by everybody minding\ntheir own business!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, well! It means much the same thing,\u201d said the Duchess, digging her\nsharp little chin into Alice\u2019s shoulder as she added, \u201cand the moral of\n_that_ is\u2014\u2018Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of\nthemselves.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cHow fond she is of finding morals in things!\u201d Alice thought to\nherself. \u201cI dare say you\u2019re wondering why I don\u2019t put my arm round your waist,\u201d\nthe Duchess said after a pause: \u201cthe reason is, that I\u2019m doubtful about\nthe temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe might bite,\u201d Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious\nto have the experiment tried. \u201cVery true,\u201d said the Duchess: \u201cflamingoes and mustard both bite. And\nthe moral of that is\u2014\u2018Birds of a feather flock together.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly mustard isn\u2019t a bird,\u201d Alice remarked. \u201cRight, as usual,\u201d said the Duchess: \u201cwhat a clear way you have of\nputting things!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mineral, I _think_,\u201d said Alice. \u201cOf course it is,\u201d said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to\neverything that Alice said; \u201cthere\u2019s a large mustard-mine near here.",

It doesn\u2019t look like one, but it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cI quite agree with you,\u201d said the Duchess; \u201cand the moral of that\nis\u2014\u2018Be what you would seem to be\u2019\u2014or if you\u2019d like it put more\nsimply\u2014\u2018Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might\nappear to others that what you were or might have been was not\notherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be\notherwise.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I should understand that better,\u201d Alice said very politely,\n\u201cif I had it written down: but I can\u2019t quite follow it as you say it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s nothing to what I could say if I chose,\u201d the Duchess replied,\nin a pleased tone. \u201cPray don\u2019t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,\u201d said\nAlice. \u201cOh, don\u2019t talk about trouble!\u201d said the Duchess. \u201cI make you a present\nof everything I\u2019ve said as yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cA cheap sort of present!\u201d thought Alice. \u201cI\u2019m glad they don\u2019t give\nbirthday presents like that!\u201d But she did not venture to say it out\nloud. \u201cThinking again?\u201d the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp\nlittle chin. \u201cI\u2019ve a right to think,\u201d said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to\nfeel a little worried. \u201cJust about as much right,\u201d said the Duchess, \u201cas pigs have to fly; and\nthe m\u2014\u201d\n\nBut here, to Alice\u2019s great surprise, the Duchess\u2019s voice died away,\neven in the middle of her favourite word \u2018moral,\u2019 and the arm that was\nlinked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the\nQueen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a\nthunderstorm. \u201cA fine day, your Majesty!\u201d the Duchess began in a low, weak voice. \u201cNow, I give you fair warning,\u201d shouted the Queen, stamping on the\nground as she spoke; \u201ceither you or your head must be off, and that in\nabout half no time! Take your choice!\u201d\n\nThe Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment. \u201cLet\u2019s go on with the game,\u201d the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too\nmuch frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the\ncroquet-ground. The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen\u2019s absence, and were\nresting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried\nback to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment\u2019s delay\nwould cost them their lives. All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling\nwith the other players, and shouting \u201cOff with his head!\u201d or \u201cOff with\nher head!\u201d Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the\nsoldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so\nthat by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and\nall the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody\nand under sentence of execution. Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, \u201cHave\nyou seen the Mock Turtle yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Alice. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what a Mock Turtle is.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,\u201d said the Queen. \u201cI never saw one, or heard of one,\u201d said Alice. \u201cCome on, then,\u201d said the Queen, \u201cand he shall tell you his history,\u201d\n\nAs they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,\nto the company generally, \u201cYou are all pardoned.\u201d \u201cCome, _that\u2019s_ a\ngood thing!\u201d she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the\nnumber of executions the Queen had ordered. They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If\nyou don\u2019t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) \u201cUp, lazy\nthing!\u201d said the Queen, \u201cand take this young lady to see the Mock\nTurtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some\nexecutions I have ordered;\u201d and she walked off, leaving Alice alone\nwith the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature,\nbut on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it\nas to go after that savage Queen: so she waited. The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till\nshe was out of sight: then it chuckled. \u201cWhat fun!\u201d said the Gryphon,\nhalf to itself, half to Alice. \u201cWhat _is_ the fun?\u201d said Alice. \u201cWhy, _she_,\u201d said the Gryphon. \u201cIt\u2019s all her fancy, that: they never\nexecutes nobody, you know. Come on!\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody says \u2018come on!\u2019 here,\u201d thought Alice, as she went slowly\nafter it: \u201cI never was so ordered about in all my life, never!\u201d\n\nThey had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,\nsitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came\nnearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She\npitied him deeply. \u201cWhat is his sorrow?\u201d she asked the Gryphon, and the\nGryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, \u201cIt\u2019s all\nhis fancy, that: he hasn\u2019t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!\u201d\n\nSo they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes\nfull of tears, but said nothing.",

Alice thought to\nherself, \u201cI don\u2019t see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesn\u2019t begin.\u201d\nBut she waited patiently. \u201cOnce,\u201d said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, \u201cI was a real\nTurtle.\u201d\n\nThese words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an\noccasional exclamation of \u201cHjckrrh!\u201d from the Gryphon, and the constant\nheavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and\nsaying, \u201cThank you, sir, for your interesting story,\u201d but she could not\nhelp thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said\nnothing. \u201cWhen we were little,\u201d the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,\nthough still sobbing a little now and then, \u201cwe went to school in the\nsea. The master was an old Turtle\u2014we used to call him Tortoise\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn\u2019t one?\u201d Alice asked. \u201cWe called him Tortoise because he taught us,\u201d said the Mock Turtle\nangrily: \u201creally you are very dull!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple\nquestion,\u201d added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked\nat poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the\nGryphon said to the Mock Turtle, \u201cDrive on, old fellow! Don\u2019t be all\nday about it!\u201d and he went on in these words:\n\n\u201cYes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn\u2019t believe it\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI never said I didn\u2019t!\u201d interrupted Alice. \u201cYou did,\u201d said the Mock Turtle. \u201cHold your tongue!\u201d added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again. The Mock Turtle went on. \u201cWe had the best of educations\u2014in fact, we went to school every day\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c_I\u2019ve_ been to a day-school, too,\u201d said Alice; \u201cyou needn\u2019t be so\nproud as all that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith extras?\u201d asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously. \u201cYes,\u201d said Alice, \u201cwe learned French and music.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd washing?\u201d said the Mock Turtle. \u201cCertainly not!\u201d said Alice indignantly. \u201cAh! then yours wasn\u2019t a really good school,\u201d said the Mock Turtle in a\ntone of great relief. \u201cNow at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill,\n\u2018French, music, _and washing_\u2014extra.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have wanted it much,\u201d said Alice; \u201cliving at the bottom\nof the sea.\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t afford to learn it.\u201d said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. \u201cI\nonly took the regular course.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d inquired Alice. \u201cReeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,\u201d the Mock Turtle\nreplied; \u201cand then the different branches of Arithmetic\u2014Ambition,\nDistraction, Uglification, and Derision.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never heard of \u2018Uglification,\u2019\u201d Alice ventured to say. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\nThe Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. \u201cWhat! Never heard of\nuglifying!\u201d it exclaimed. \u201cYou know what to beautify is, I suppose?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Alice doubtfully: \u201cit means\u2014to\u2014make\u2014anything\u2014prettier.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, then,\u201d the Gryphon went on, \u201cif you don\u2019t know what to uglify\nis, you _are_ a simpleton.\u201d\n\nAlice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so\nshe turned to the Mock Turtle, and said \u201cWhat else had you to learn?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, there was Mystery,\u201d the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the\nsubjects on his flappers, \u201c\u2014Mystery, ancient and modern, with\nSeaography: then Drawling\u2014the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,\nthat used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and\nFainting in Coils.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was _that_ like?\u201d said Alice. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t show it you myself,\u201d the Mock Turtle said: \u201cI\u2019m too\nstiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHadn\u2019t time,\u201d said the Gryphon: \u201cI went to the Classics master,\nthough. He was an old crab, _he_ was.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never went to him,\u201d the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: \u201che taught\nLaughing and Grief, they used to say.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo he did, so he did,\u201d said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both\ncreatures hid their faces in their paws. \u201cAnd how many hours a day did you do lessons?\u201d said Alice, in a hurry\nto change the subject. \u201cTen hours the first day,\u201d said the Mock Turtle: \u201cnine the next, and so\non.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a curious plan!\u201d exclaimed Alice. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason they\u2019re called lessons,\u201d the Gryphon remarked:\n\u201cbecause they lessen from day to day.\u201d\n\nThis was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little\nbefore she made her next remark. \u201cThen the eleventh day must have been\na holiday?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course it was,\u201d said the Mock Turtle. \u201cAnd how did you manage on the twelfth?\u201d Alice went on eagerly. \u201cThat\u2019s enough about lessons,\u201d the Gryphon interrupted in a very\ndecided tone: \u201ctell her something about the games now.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. The Lobster Quadrille\n\n\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across\nhis eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or\ntwo sobs choked his voice. \u201cSame as if he had a bone in his throat,\u201d\nsaid the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in\nthe back.",

Which shall sing?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, _you_ sing,\u201d said the Gryphon. \u201cI\u2019ve forgotten the words.\u201d\n\nSo they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and\nthen treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their\nforepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly\nand sadly:\u2014\n\n\u201cWill you walk a little faster?\u201d said a whiting to a snail. \u201cThere\u2019s a porpoise close behind us, and he\u2019s treading on my tail. See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance! They are waiting on the shingle\u2014will you come and join the dance? Will you, won\u2019t you, will you, won\u2019t you, will you join the dance? Will you, won\u2019t you, will you, won\u2019t you, won\u2019t you join the dance? \u201cYou can really have no notion how delightful it will be\nWhen they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!\u201d\nBut the snail replied \u201cToo far, too far!\u201d and gave a look askance\u2014\nSaid he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance. Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance. Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance. \u201cWhat matters it how far we go?\u201d his scaly friend replied. \u201cThere is another shore, you know, upon the other side. The further off from England the nearer is to France\u2014\nThen turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance. Will you, won\u2019t you, will you, won\u2019t you, will you join the dance? Will you, won\u2019t you, will you, won\u2019t you, won\u2019t you join the dance?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThank you, it\u2019s a very interesting dance to watch,\u201d said Alice,\nfeeling very glad that it was over at last: \u201cand I do so like that\ncurious song about the whiting!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, as to the whiting,\u201d said the Mock Turtle, \u201cthey\u2014you\u2019ve seen them,\nof course?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Alice, \u201cI\u2019ve often seen them at dinn\u2014\u201d she checked herself\nhastily. \u201cI don\u2019t know where Dinn may be,\u201d said the Mock Turtle, \u201cbut if you\u2019ve\nseen them so often, of course you know what they\u2019re like.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe so,\u201d Alice replied thoughtfully. \u201cThey have their tails in\ntheir mouths\u2014and they\u2019re all over crumbs.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re wrong about the crumbs,\u201d said the Mock Turtle: \u201ccrumbs would\nall wash off in the sea. But they _have_ their tails in their mouths;\nand the reason is\u2014\u201d here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his\neyes.\u2014\u201cTell her about the reason and all that,\u201d he said to the Gryphon. \u201cThe reason is,\u201d said the Gryphon, \u201cthat they _would_ go with the\nlobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to\nfall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they\ncouldn\u2019t get them out again. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Alice, \u201cit\u2019s very interesting. I never knew so much\nabout a whiting before.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can tell you more than that, if you like,\u201d said the Gryphon. \u201cDo you\nknow why it\u2019s called a whiting?\u201d\n\n\u201cI never thought about it,\u201d said Alice. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201c_It does the boots and shoes_,\u201d the Gryphon replied very solemnly. Alice was thoroughly puzzled. \u201cDoes the boots and shoes!\u201d she repeated\nin a wondering tone. \u201cWhy, what are _your_ shoes done with?\u201d said the Gryphon. \u201cI mean, what\nmakes them so shiny?\u201d\n\nAlice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her\nanswer.",

Now you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what are they made of?\u201d Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity. \u201cSoles and eels, of course,\u201d the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:\n\u201cany shrimp could have told you that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019d been the whiting,\u201d said Alice, whose thoughts were still\nrunning on the song, \u201cI\u2019d have said to the porpoise, \u2018Keep back,\nplease: we don\u2019t want _you_ with us!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were obliged to have him with them,\u201d the Mock Turtle said: \u201cno\nwise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.\u201d\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it really?\u201d said Alice in a tone of great surprise. \u201cOf course not,\u201d said the Mock Turtle: \u201cwhy, if a fish came to _me_,\nand told me he was going a journey, I should say \u2018With what porpoise?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you mean \u2018purpose\u2019?\u201d said Alice. \u201cI mean what I say,\u201d the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And\nthe Gryphon added \u201cCome, let\u2019s hear some of _your_ adventures.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could tell you my adventures\u2014beginning from this morning,\u201d said\nAlice a little timidly: \u201cbut it\u2019s no use going back to yesterday,\nbecause I was a different person then.\u201d\n\n\u201cExplain all that,\u201d said the Mock Turtle. \u201cNo, no! The adventures first,\u201d said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:\n\u201cexplanations take such a dreadful time.\u201d\n\nSo Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first\nsaw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,\nthe two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened\ntheir eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she\nwent on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part\nabout her repeating \u201c_You are old, Father William_,\u201d to the\nCaterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock\nTurtle drew a long breath, and said \u201cThat\u2019s very curious.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about as curious as it can be,\u201d said the Gryphon. \u201cIt all came different!\u201d the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. \u201cI\nshould like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to\nbegin.\u201d He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of\nauthority over Alice. \u201cStand up and repeat \u2018\u2019_Tis the voice of the sluggard_,\u2019\u201d said the\nGryphon. \u201cHow the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!\u201d\nthought Alice; \u201cI might as well be at school at once.\u201d However, she got\nup, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster\nQuadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came\nvery queer indeed:\u2014\n\n\u201c\u2019Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,\n\u201cYou have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.\u201d\nAs a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose\nTrims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.\u201d\n\n[later editions continued as follows\nWhen the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,\nAnd will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,\nBut, when the tide rises and sharks are around,\nHis voice has a timid and tremulous sound.] \u201cThat\u2019s different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child,\u201d said\nthe Gryphon. \u201cWell, I never heard it before,\u201d said the Mock Turtle; \u201cbut it sounds\nuncommon nonsense.\u201d\n\nAlice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,\nwondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again. \u201cI should like to have it explained,\u201d said the Mock Turtle. \u201cShe can\u2019t explain it,\u201d said the Gryphon hastily. \u201cGo on with the next\nverse.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut about his toes?\u201d the Mock Turtle persisted. \u201cHow _could_ he turn\nthem out with his nose, you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first position in dancing.\u201d Alice said; but was dreadfully\npuzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject. \u201cGo on with the next verse,\u201d the Gryphon repeated impatiently: \u201cit\nbegins \u2018_I passed by his garden_.\u2019\u201d\n\nAlice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come\nwrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:\u2014\n\n\u201cI passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,\nHow the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie\u2014\u201d\n\n[later editions continued as follows\nThe Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,\nWhile the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat. When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,\nWas kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:\nWhile the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,\nAnd concluded the banquet\u2014]\n\n\n\u201cWhat _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff,\u201d the Mock Turtle\ninterrupted, \u201cif you don\u2019t explain it as you go on? It\u2019s by far the\nmost confusing thing _I_ ever heard!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I think you\u2019d better leave off,\u201d said the Gryphon: and Alice was\nonly too glad to do so. \u201cShall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?\u201d the Gryphon\nwent on. \u201cOr would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,\u201d Alice\nreplied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,\n\u201cHm! No accounting for tastes!",

Who for such dainties would not stoop? Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup! Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup! Beau\u2014ootiful Soo\u2014oop! Beau\u2014ootiful Soo\u2014oop!

Who Stole the Tarts? The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they\narrived, with a great crowd assembled about them\u2014all sorts of little\nbirds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was\nstanding before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard\nhim; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one\nhand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the\ncourt was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so\ngood, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them\u2014\u201cI wish they\u2019d\nget the trial done,\u201d she thought, \u201cand hand round the refreshments!\u201d\nBut there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at\neverything about her, to pass away the time. Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read\nabout them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew\nthe name of nearly everything there. \u201cThat\u2019s the judge,\u201d she said to\nherself, \u201cbecause of his great wig.\u201d\n\nThe judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the\nwig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he\ndid not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the jury-box,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cand those twelve creatures,\u201d\n(she was obliged to say \u201ccreatures,\u201d you see, because some of them were\nanimals, and some were birds,) \u201cI suppose they are the jurors.\u201d She\nsaid this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather\nproud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little\ngirls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, \u201cjury-men\u201d\nwould have done just as well. The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. \u201cWhat are\nthey doing?\u201d Alice whispered to the Gryphon. \u201cThey can\u2019t have anything\nto put down yet, before the trial\u2019s begun.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re putting down their names,\u201d the Gryphon whispered in reply,\n\u201cfor fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.\u201d\n\n\u201cStupid things!\u201d Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she\nstopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, \u201cSilence in the\ncourt!\u201d and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round,\nto make out who was talking. Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,\nthat all the jurors were writing down \u201cstupid things!\u201d on their slates,\nand she could even make out that one of them didn\u2019t know how to spell\n\u201cstupid,\u201d and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. \u201cA nice\nmuddle their slates\u2019ll be in before the trial\u2019s over!\u201d thought Alice. One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice\ncould _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and\nvery soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly\nthat the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out\nat all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he\nwas obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this\nwas of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate. \u201cHerald, read the accusation!\u201d said the King. On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then\nunrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:\u2014\n\n\u201cThe Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,\n    All on a summer day:\nThe Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,\n    And took them quite away!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cConsider your verdict,\u201d the King said to the jury. \u201cNot yet, not yet!\u201d the Rabbit hastily interrupted. \u201cThere\u2019s a great\ndeal to come before that!\u201d\n\n\u201cCall the first witness,\u201d said the King; and the White Rabbit blew\nthree blasts on the trumpet, and called out, \u201cFirst witness!\u201d\n\nThe first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand\nand a piece of bread-and-butter in the other.",

I\u2019m a hatter.\u201d\n\nHere the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,\nwho turned pale and fidgeted. \u201cGive your evidence,\u201d said the King; \u201cand don\u2019t be nervous, or I\u2019ll\nhave you executed on the spot.\u201d\n\nThis did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting\nfrom one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his\nconfusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the\nbread-and-butter. Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled\nher a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to\ngrow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave\nthe court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was\nas long as there was room for her. \u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t squeeze so.\u201d said the Dormouse, who was sitting\nnext to her. \u201cI can hardly breathe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d said Alice very meekly: \u201cI\u2019m growing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve no right to grow _here_,\u201d said the Dormouse. \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense,\u201d said Alice more boldly: \u201cyou know you\u2019re growing\ntoo.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace,\u201d said the Dormouse: \u201cnot in\nthat ridiculous fashion.\u201d And he got up very sulkily and crossed over\nto the other side of the court. All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,\njust as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers\nof the court, \u201cBring me the list of the singers in the last concert!\u201d\non which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes\noff. \u201cGive your evidence,\u201d the King repeated angrily, \u201cor I\u2019ll have you\nexecuted, whether you\u2019re nervous or not.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a poor man, your Majesty,\u201d the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,\n\u201c\u2014and I hadn\u2019t begun my tea\u2014not above a week or so\u2014and what with the\nbread-and-butter getting so thin\u2014and the twinkling of the tea\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe twinkling of the _what?_\u201d said the King. \u201cIt _began_ with the tea,\u201d the Hatter replied. \u201cOf course twinkling begins with a T!\u201d said the King sharply. \u201cDo you\ntake me for a dunce? Go on!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a poor man,\u201d the Hatter went on, \u201cand most things twinkled after\nthat\u2014only the March Hare said\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t!\u201d the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry. \u201cYou did!\u201d said the Hatter. \u201cI deny it!\u201d said the March Hare. \u201cHe denies it,\u201d said the King: \u201cleave out that part.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, at any rate, the Dormouse said\u2014\u201d the Hatter went on, looking\nanxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied\nnothing, being fast asleep. \u201cAfter that,\u201d continued the Hatter, \u201cI cut some more bread-and-butter\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what did the Dormouse say?\u201d one of the jury asked. \u201cThat I can\u2019t remember,\u201d said the Hatter. \u201cYou _must_ remember,\u201d remarked the King, \u201cor I\u2019ll have you executed.\u201d\n\nThe miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went\ndown on one knee. \u201cI\u2019m a poor man, your Majesty,\u201d he began. \u201cYou\u2019re a _very_ poor _speaker_,\u201d said the King. Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by\nthe officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just\nexplain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied\nup at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,\nhead first, and then sat upon it.) \u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019ve seen that done,\u201d thought Alice. \u201cI\u2019ve so often read in\nthe newspapers, at the end of trials, \u201cThere was some attempts at\napplause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the\ncourt,\u201d and I never understood what it meant till now.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s all you know about it, you may stand down,\u201d continued the\nKing. \u201cI can\u2019t go no lower,\u201d said the Hatter: \u201cI\u2019m on the floor, as it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you may _sit_ down,\u201d the King replied. Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed. \u201cCome, that finished the guinea-pigs!\u201d thought Alice. \u201cNow we shall get\non better.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather finish my tea,\u201d said the Hatter, with an anxious look at\nthe Queen, who was reading the list of singers. \u201cYou may go,\u201d said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,\nwithout even waiting to put his shoes on.",

The next witness was the Duchess\u2019s cook. She carried the pepper-box in\nher hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the\ncourt, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once. \u201cGive your evidence,\u201d said the King. \u201cShan\u2019t,\u201d said the cook. The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,\n\u201cYour Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, if I must, I must,\u201d the King said, with a melancholy air, and,\nafter folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were\nnearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, \u201cWhat are tarts made of?\u201d\n\n\u201cPepper, mostly,\u201d said the cook. \u201cTreacle,\u201d said a sleepy voice behind her. \u201cCollar that Dormouse,\u201d the Queen shrieked out. \u201cBehead that Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his\nwhiskers!\u201d\n\nFor some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse\nturned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had\ndisappeared. \u201cNever mind!\u201d said the King, with an air of great relief. \u201cCall the\nnext witness.\u201d And he added in an undertone to the Queen, \u201cReally, my\ndear, _you_ must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my\nforehead ache!\u201d\n\nAlice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling\nvery curious to see what the next witness would be like, \u201c\u2014for they\nhaven\u2019t got much evidence _yet_,\u201d she said to herself. Imagine her\nsurprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill\nlittle voice, the name \u201cAlice!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. Alice\u2019s Evidence\n\n\n\u201cHere!\u201d cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how\nlarge she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such\na hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,\nupsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there\nthey lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of\ngoldfish she had accidentally upset the week before. \u201cOh, I _beg_ your pardon!\u201d she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and\nbegan picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident\nof the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of\nidea that they must be collected at once and put back into the\njury-box, or they would die. \u201cThe trial cannot proceed,\u201d said the King in a very grave voice, \u201cuntil\nall the jurymen are back in their proper places\u2014_all_,\u201d he repeated\nwith great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so. Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put\nthe Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its\ntail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon\ngot it out again, and put it right; \u201cnot that it signifies much,\u201d she\nsaid to herself; \u201cI should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the\ntrial one way up as the other.\u201d\n\nAs soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being\nupset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to\nthem, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the\naccident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do\nanything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the\ncourt. \u201cWhat do you know about this business?\u201d the King said to Alice. \u201cNothing,\u201d said Alice. \u201cNothing _whatever?_\u201d persisted the King. \u201cNothing whatever,\u201d said Alice. \u201cThat\u2019s very important,\u201d the King said, turning to the jury. They were\njust beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White\nRabbit interrupted: \u201c_Un_important, your Majesty means, of course,\u201d he\nsaid in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as\nhe spoke. \u201c_Un_important, of course, I meant,\u201d the King hastily said, and went on\nto himself in an undertone,\n\n\u201cimportant\u2014unimportant\u2014unimportant\u2014important\u2014\u201d as if he were trying\nwhich word sounded best. Some of the jury wrote it down \u201cimportant,\u201d and some \u201cunimportant.\u201d\nAlice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;\n\u201cbut it doesn\u2019t matter a bit,\u201d she thought to herself. At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in\nhis note-book, cackled out \u201cSilence!\u201d and read out from his book, \u201cRule\nForty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.\u201d\n\nEverybody looked at Alice. \u201c_I\u2019m_ not a mile high,\u201d said Alice. \u201cYou are,\u201d said the King. \u201cNearly two miles high,\u201d added the Queen. \u201cWell, I shan\u2019t go, at any rate,\u201d said Alice: \u201cbesides, that\u2019s not a\nregular rule: you invented it just now.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the oldest rule in the book,\u201d said the King. \u201cThen it ought to be Number One,\u201d said Alice. The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. \u201cConsider your\nverdict,\u201d he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.",

(The jury\nall brightened up again.) \u201cPlease your Majesty,\u201d said the Knave, \u201cI didn\u2019t write it, and they\ncan\u2019t prove I did: there\u2019s no name signed at the end.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you didn\u2019t sign it,\u201d said the King, \u201cthat only makes the matter\nworse. You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you\u2019d have signed\nyour name like an honest man.\u201d\n\nThere was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really\nclever thing the King had said that day. \u201cThat _proves_ his guilt,\u201d said the Queen. \u201cIt proves nothing of the sort!\u201d said Alice. \u201cWhy, you don\u2019t even know\nwhat they\u2019re about!\u201d\n\n\u201cRead them,\u201d said the King. The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. \u201cWhere shall I begin, please\nyour Majesty?\u201d he asked. \u201cBegin at the beginning,\u201d the King said gravely, \u201cand go on till you\ncome to the end: then stop.\u201d\n\nThese were the verses the White Rabbit read:\u2014\n\n\u201cThey told me you had been to her,\n    And mentioned me to him:\nShe gave me a good character,\n    But said I could not swim. He sent them word I had not gone\n    (We know it to be true):\nIf she should push the matter on,\n    What would become of you? I gave her one, they gave him two,\n    You gave us three or more;\nThey all returned from him to you,\n    Though they were mine before. If I or she should chance to be\n    Involved in this affair,\nHe trusts to you to set them free,\n    Exactly as we were. My notion was that you had been\n    (Before she had this fit)\nAn obstacle that came between\n    Him, and ourselves, and it. Don\u2019t let him know she liked them best,\n    For this must ever be\nA secret, kept from all the rest,\n    Between yourself and me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the most important piece of evidence we\u2019ve heard yet,\u201d said the\nKing, rubbing his hands; \u201cso now let the jury\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIf any one of them can explain it,\u201d said Alice, (she had grown so\nlarge in the last few minutes that she wasn\u2019t a bit afraid of\ninterrupting him,) \u201cI\u2019ll give him sixpence. _I_ don\u2019t believe there\u2019s\nan atom of meaning in it.\u201d\n\nThe jury all wrote down on their slates, \u201c_She_ doesn\u2019t believe there\u2019s\nan atom of meaning in it,\u201d but none of them attempted to explain the\npaper. \u201cIf there\u2019s no meaning in it,\u201d said the King, \u201cthat saves a world of\ntrouble, you know, as we needn\u2019t try to find any. And yet I don\u2019t\nknow,\u201d he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at\nthem with one eye; \u201cI seem to see some meaning in them, after all. \u201c\u2014_said I could not swim_\u2014\u201d you can\u2019t swim, can you?\u201d he added, turning\nto the Knave. The Knave shook his head sadly. \u201cDo I look like it?\u201d he said. (Which he\ncertainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.) \u201cAll right, so far,\u201d said the King, and he went on muttering over the\nverses to himself: \u201c\u2018_We know it to be true_\u2014\u2019 that\u2019s the jury, of\ncourse\u2014\u2018_I gave her one, they gave him two_\u2014\u2019 why, that must be what he\ndid with the tarts, you know\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, it goes on \u2018_they all returned from him to you_,\u2019\u201d said Alice. \u201cWhy, there they are!\u201d said the King triumphantly, pointing to the\ntarts on the table. \u201cNothing can be clearer than _that_. Then\nagain\u2014\u2018_before she had this fit_\u2014\u2019 you never had fits, my dear, I\nthink?\u201d he said to the Queen. \u201cNever!\u201d said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard\nas she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his\nslate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily\nbegan again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long\nas it lasted.) \u201cThen the words don\u2019t _fit_ you,\u201d said the King, looking round the\ncourt with a smile. There was a dead silence. \u201cIt\u2019s a pun!\u201d the King added in an offended tone, and everybody\nlaughed, \u201cLet the jury consider their verdict,\u201d the King said, for\nabout the twentieth time that day. \u201cNo, no!\u201d said the Queen. \u201cSentence first\u2014verdict afterwards.\u201d\n\n\u201cStuff and nonsense!\u201d said Alice loudly. \u201cThe idea of having the\nsentence first!\u201d\n\n\u201cHold your tongue!\u201d said the Queen, turning purple. \u201cI won\u2019t!\u201d said Alice. \u201cOff with her head!\u201d the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody\nmoved. \u201cWho cares for you?\u201d said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by\nthis time.)",

But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her\nhand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all\nher wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,\nand this was her dream:\u2014\n\nFirst, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny\nhands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were\nlooking up into hers\u2014she could hear the very tones of her voice, and\nsee that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair\nthat _would_ always get into her eyes\u2014and still as she listened, or\nseemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the\nstrange creatures of her little sister\u2019s dream. The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by\u2014the\nfrightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool\u2014she\ncould hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends\nshared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen\nordering off her unfortunate guests to execution\u2014once more the pig-baby\nwas sneezing on the Duchess\u2019s knee, while plates and dishes crashed\naround it\u2014once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the\nLizard\u2019s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\nfilled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock\nTurtle. So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\nWonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all\nwould change to dull reality\u2014the grass would be only rustling in the\nwind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds\u2014the rattling\nteacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen\u2019s shrill\ncries to the voice of the shepherd boy\u2014and the sneeze of the baby, the\nshriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change\n(she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard\u2014while the\nlowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock\nTurtle\u2019s heavy sobs. Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers\nwould, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would\nkeep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her\nchildhood: and how she would gather about her other little children,\nand make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,\nperhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she\nwould feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all\ntheir simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer\ndays.

      "text": "Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS. The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate. While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate. International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff. Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate. Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support. Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition. Most people start at our website which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org. This website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.",
